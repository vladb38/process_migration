To be able to compile the kernel modules you will need to create four symlinks in this directory:

@ -> /usr/src/sys
machine -> /usr/src/sys/amd64/include
usr/machine -> /usr/src/sys/amd64/include
usr/sys -> /usr/src/sys

Then run "make" in the current directory.

In order to test the kernel module, compile the "hellosimple.c" code in the "example" directory
and compile it as a static executable using:

"gcc -static -o hellosimple hellosimple.c"

You can then follow the instructions in the youtube video and see whether you are able to move
this simple process from one host to another:

Let me know if you have questions, doubts, suggestions.
